    ours to move (`Footing`, the `Kind` keys, the health aggregates). The line

    a diff that never mentions the contract.

    the declarations themselves, so it cannot drift from them: change a field,
    a variant, or a serde tag, and the recorded digest stops matching until
    somebody writes the new one down.

    Recording the digest is not on its own the promise; moving `CONTRACT` is.

    Anywhere else it is a check silently switched off for every anchor behind
    that transport -- which is what shell did while the description sat in a
    recipe file the transport never saw.

    The rule reads the body of `Transport::resolve` rather than the whole file,
