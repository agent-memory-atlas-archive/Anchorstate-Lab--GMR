/**
 * @anchorstate-lab/gmr — the verb table.
 *
 * These declarations describe `gmr.contract.v13.0`. That string is what a caller
 * pins to know which shapes they may match on: a contract type that changes
 * shape without it moving is a break they were told did not happen, and
 * tools/gate.py fails the build when the two disagree.
 *
 * The version has two segments: `v<breaking>.<additive>`. The additive segment
 * moves when an output type gains a variant or an optional field - survivable
 * by any consumer, under one rule this surface asks of every reader (the same
 * rule protobuf asks with unknown fields): **an exhaustive match over a
 * discriminant must keep a fallback arm**, because a runtime one additive step
 * ahead of these declarations may hand you a discriminant they do not name
 * yet. The breaking segment moves when anything is removed, renamed, or
 * re-meant - the only changes a fallback arm cannot survive. The same rule
 * holds for scripts parsing the CLI's `--json` output, whose binary upgrades
 * independently of anything pinning this file.
 *
 * Every refusal and failure is thrown with a message of the form
 * `<kind>: <message>`, where kind is a stable snake_case token — `refused`
 * (the console would not parse the ask), `assembly` (the runtime could not be
 * put together), `internal`, or a runtime code such as `not_bound`,
 * `no_such_anchor`, `no_provider`, `condensed_into_nothing`. Match the token,
 * not the prose.
