# `observe`'s exit code answers a different question than `check`'s, and that difference is load-bearing

Both walk the same anchors and both call `rt.observe`, which made a CLI-surface pass
consider `observe` dead weight next to `check` — `check` calls into
`observe.rs#delivered`/`observe.rs#report_unclaimed` already, so the two verbs share
their delivery logic. Their **exit codes** do not share a meaning, and that is not an
oversight to fix by pointing one verb's callers at the other.

`observe.rs#run` exits 1 whenever `moved > 0` — `moved` counts every
`Observed::Transitioned`, full stop. It does not ask whether any memory was bound to
that anchor, let alone whether a subscription's `watch:` cared about the axis that
moved.

`Observed::Contended` prints and does not count — in both verbs. Another writer
recorded first and nothing was written, so there is no transition to report and no
reason to fail a run: the anchor is exactly as observed or unobserved as it was
before. `check` lists contended anchors in their own section and JSON field rather
than silently skipping them, because "the holder is observing this one" and "this
one was looked at and is quiet" are different sentences; it still refuses to let
the condition touch the exit code, since a red there would bill normal concurrency
to CI.

`check.rs#run` exits 1 for `handed` (a memory was actually delivered) or `unclaimed`
(moved with no memory bound at all — and this obligation derives from the standing
vector, not from this run's transition: a pass or sample that consumed the edge
does not make an unbound moved anchor green, `observe.rs#unclaimed_due` holds that
line, with shapeless states keeping the edge because nothing there says what
settled means) or one of the criteria/instrument diagnoses ([[check-drift]]) — but
explicitly *not* for `quiet`: an anchor that moved on an axis no memory's `watch:`
names is deliberately reported at exit 0, as "N anchors moved on axes nobody asked
about — `gmr status` shows them." That distinction is the entire reason `check`
computes `moved`/`quiet` separately instead of just counting transitions.

That exit-0 branch is real; the sentence quoting it is not always printed.
`check`'s closing `match (handed.len(), quiet)` makes the two arms exclusive,
so when a memory was handed back *and* something moved unwatched, only the
first line prints and `quiet` is dropped from the human output. `--json` still
carries it as `moved_unwatched`, which is the reliable reading. The exit code —
the thing this memory is about — is unaffected either way.

So `observe`'s signal is "did the state machine move at all" (every axis, every
anchor, subscribed or not); `check`'s is "does a human need to look" (filtered through
what memories actually watch). A script polling `gmr observe`'s exit code and a script
polling `gmr check`'s exit code can disagree on the same repository state, and both
are answering the question they were built to answer.

## When this changes, ask

Converging these into one exit-code meaning is a change to what counts as a
reportable movement — CLAUDE.md §7's "criteria: probe, rules, terminal, state revision
semantics" is exactly this kind of call, and it needs the owner's decision plus an
announced breaking change (any script keyed to `observe`'s current "any transition"
exit code silently starts seeing fewer failures, or `check` silently starts seeing
more). It cannot be done as a side effect of collapsing CLI surface.
