# The capture rule has to demand a hit first

The first rule expanded demands a reading before it will capture one; only the
second is the `absent` one for when nothing was hit. **That order is a criterion,
not a style.**

Written the other way round (capture first, check the hit second), "the coordinate
points at something that does not exist" succeeds silently: when `file` matches and
`name`/`heading` does not, the probe does not error, it falls back to another
candidate in the same file, giving `found: true` with `exact: false`. A capture rule
that does not look at `exact` pins **that wrong thing** as the baseline and then
reports `settled` — from then on it watches the wrong object, and no rule can ever
fire again, because `baseline` now exists.

This is not hypothetical. This repository's `doctrine::red-cards` was broken this way
for a whole stretch of history: it points at a section of CLAUDE.md deleted back in
`5f6b22d`, fell back to the first heading in the file, and had a fingerprint identical
to `doctrine::decisions` (`bac58fed`, both at line 7) while showing as settled. The
`fingerprint` shape was later fixed to this order.

### The guard is `obs.found`, and this note used to claim it was `obs.exact`

It is not, and it has not been since `28287b2` first generated these rules. That
sentence sat here describing code that did not exist, which is the drift this whole
repository is built to catch — and it was caught, by an anchor on `expand`, the
first time anyone touched the function.

**The argument it was making is still open and still good**, so it is kept rather
than deleted: `found` only says *some* item matched, not that the item identifying
this thing matched. A coordinate whose `file` hits and whose `name` misses can fall
back to another candidate in the same file and report `found: true, exact: false` —
which is the hole the section above describes, still guarded only by the
`fingerprint` shape having been fixed to this order.

Moving the guard to `obs.exact` is a **criteria change** under CLAUDE.md §7: it
would alter what every existing anchor accepts as an opening reading, so it is the
owner's call and not a tidy-up. Until then this note says what the code says.

## The guard is now derived from the shape, not spelled into the generator

`reported` picks it: a shape carrying the `missing` axis reports absence *inside its
facts*, so it is asked for `obs.found`; a shape without one is asked instead that
its own readings exist. That second branch is what let the `value` shape arrive —
the http probe answers a 404 with `Outcome::NotFound`, which the base already
reports as `Holding::Absent`, so asking it for a `found` flag as well would record
one fact on two axes with nothing comparing them. See [[transport-http]].

Deriving it moved nothing for the three shapes that had one: a test asserts all
three still open on `obs.found`, and another asserts `value` never mentions it.

## Three sections in order, and the middle one is now derived

The rules come in three sections: **two opening rules → every `Now` axis → every
`Since` axis → a catch-all `true`**.

The middle section used to be one hard-coded `obs.exact == false => missing`. Now
each `Reads::Now` axis generates one — but the position is unchanged, and **must
stay unchanged**: a `Now` axis holding says "this reading is not about my target", so
its rule keeps the last good reading and carries every `Since` bit through
untouched. Let any `Since` rule run ahead of it and you compare another object's
reading against the baseline, pinning the whole vector in one go. The criterion is in
[[shapes-Dim]].

## When this changes, ask

A new rule got inserted ahead of the first → ask whether it can write a baseline
while none exists yet. If it can, it is a second capture entry point and has to
demand a reading just like the first.

A new shape arrives with no `missing` axis → check that its probe reports absence
as `Outcome::NotFound` rather than inside its facts. `reported` will ask only that
its readings exist, and a probe that answers "found nothing" with a *present* field
would sail past that guard and pin a baseline made of nothing.

This hole is **structurally impossible** to reintroduce: capture rules are not
hand-written, they are generated from a shape's `Dim`s, and every shape has that one
entry point. A shape carrying its own rule table would be a second capture path, walked
by nobody and checked by nothing — which is why there are generators and no
hand-written tables beside them.

There are two generators over the same `Dim`s: `expand` for the base shapes, whose
tables are byte-identical to what every open anchor runs, and `expand_dwell` for the
`-dwell` shapes, which add `phase`, `moved_count`, `last_moved_at` and `last_present`
to the state. `expand_dwell` does put one rule ahead of the capture rule, and the
question above was asked of it: its guard is `exists(state.baseline) and not
exists(state.moved_count)`, so it can only touch a state that already captured, and it
writes no baseline. It exists so an anchor switched from the base table is given the
new fields before any rule interprets an observation through them.
