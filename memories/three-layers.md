# Fact, memory and inference are three things, and the mechanism they share is not the layer

Fact is what a probe reads: the code, the menu, the registry. Recomputable, no
author. Memory is a **long-lived constraint on that fact** — written by a person,
reviewed in a commit, and not derivable from the fact, because a constraint you
can derive is one nobody needed to write. Inference is what one analysis
concluded for the task in front of it: one-shot, not yet condensed into anything.

They fail differently, and that is what makes them three:

```
memory     drifts       the code moved; whether what was written still holds is unknown
inference  loses ground the reading it rested on moved, or it never looked at it
```

The processing is different too, and this is the part that is easy to get wrong.
A memory whose coordinate moved is **not false** — it is due. The verdict needs a
person, which is why `check` says "re-read it" and `accept` demands a sealed
`--why`. An inference whose stated condition failed needs nobody: the sentence is
simply no longer supported, and there is nothing to re-read.

## Two loops, and the copy that nothing watches

```
memory     check  -> handed back -> a person re-reads -> accept --why
inference  ground -> holding / shown / depends -> the caller decides
```

This note exists because the merge was nearly made. `watch:` in a note and
`depends` on a binding are both predicates over anchor state, written in the same
expression language, and it looked obvious that one should be built out of the
other — compile each note's `watch:` into a `depends` at `sync` time and have
`check` read it back from the store.

What breaks is not that two loops became one. It is that `depends` would be **a
copy nothing watches**. `check`'s whole job is comparing code against memory;
pointed at the store it would compare code against *a copy of the memory taken at
the last sync*, and nothing in the system compares that copy back to the note. The
one drift this system exists to catch, manufactured in the checker.

So the test for any derived copy is **does something watch it against its
source**, not how many loops there are. A binding's `rests_on` paths are derived
from the same `watch:` and are safe under it: the binding records `bound_version`
and `memory.rs` fetches the note at that version, so the note moving is visible.
`depends` records nothing of the kind.

And the reverse merge — keeping an inference as if it were memory — promotes a
one-shot conclusion into a constraint nobody reviewed.

The polarities differ for the same reason, and it is not an inconsistency to be
tidied away. `watch:` is true when the memory must come back; `depends` is true
while the claim still stands. "Bring this back for judgement" and "this still
holds" are not the same predicate wearing two signs.

## Where a criterion lives is decided by which layer it is

**A memory's criteria live in the repository**, in the file, read fresh — so
editing `watch:` takes effect on the next `check` with no build step between the
author and the checker. A binding may still store the paths that `watch:`
produced, because `bound_version` keeps that copy answerable to the file; what
may not happen is `check` reading the criteria out of the store instead of the
file.

**An inference's criteria live in the append-only log** — unchangeable, because
they are not a source of truth to be re-read but evidence of what was believed at
the time.

`Source::independent()` already records this axis and always has: `Derived` and
`Adjudicated` are the repository speaking, `SelfAttested` is an agent vouching
for itself ([[store-binding-record]]). A `depends` written by `sync` under
`Derived` would be the first thing in the system to sit on the wrong side of it.

## When this changes, ask

Does something start deriving one layer from another? Ask which failure mode the
derived copy now has, and whether anything watches the copy against its source. A memory derived from a fact is redundant; an inference
kept as memory is unreviewed; a memory read out of the inference log is the
checker checking against itself.

Does a verb start applying an inference's processing to a memory — marking a note
`broken` rather than handing it back? That deletes the human judgement the
`--why` seal exists to record, and [[check-drift]] is where the loop is defined.
