# What the fact did, and how we know — two axes, because they are both true at once

`Warrant` answers "does this memory's ground still hold". It is a struct of two
enums, not one enum, and the reason is a case that is not rare:

```
a statute was version A when the note was bound
we later observed it change to B          -> the ground moved, established
today the registry is down                -> the last attempt failed
```

Both are true. Report only the outage and the one certain thing here — that it
moved — is thrown away. Report only the move and it claims a currency we do not
have. A flat enum can return one of them.

That case is not a corner. **It is the steady state of every anchor whose probe
has started failing**: the transition is in the log and the observing has
stopped.

```
holding    Holds · Finished · Moved{axes, at} · Incomparable{took, reads} ·
           Absent · NeverEstablished · Undated
knowledge  Seen{at, verifiability} · Blind{since, why}
```

`Finished` is checked before anything else, including `Absent`: a closed
anchor's journal is frozen, so every other variant would be an answer about a
comparison that can never change again. `Holds` there did not mean verified —
it meant nobody can look any more, and a reader could not tell those apart.
The claim's ground has not moved; it has ended, and what to do about a
conclusion whose ground ended is the caller's policy, not this enum's.

`holding` is the main axis, for three reasons. The product answers "do these
grounds still hold", and holding is always relative to the moment of binding.
`bound_at_seq` exists for exactly this comparison and nothing else. And
[[runtime-grounding]]'s main axis is the same shape — `Current` / `Rewritten`
relative to the bound version — with "could we retrieve the old one" as its
annotation, not its sibling.

## This is `Grounding`'s shape, deliberately

`Grounding::Rewritten` carries `before: Before`, and `Before` has its own
`Unreachable`. That design already decided that "the record changed" and "we
could not fetch the old version" are independent, and expressed it by nesting
rather than by making them siblings. `Warrant` is the same decision on the fact
side.

## The flat fold that used to live here was a verdict, and it left

`Warrant` briefly shipped a third type beside it: `Bearing`, eight flat variants,
produced by `bearing()` folding the two axes into one. Its precedence rule was
**blindness only downgrades a claim that depends on currency** — `Moved`
survives, `Holds` does not.

Read that rule again as a sentence about the caller. It says *when you may still
rely on this*. `Moved > Blind` and `Holds + Blind -> Blind` are not facts about
what was observed; they are one policy about what to do with two facts that are
both true. GMR does not emit verdicts — that reduction is the caller's, and
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1.4 puts it outside. The rule is not lost: it is written
down as the **draft default policy for the warrant-to-verdict adapter**, which is
where a named, optional, versioned reduction belongs.

The justification for shipping it here was symmetry with `Grounding::footing()`,
and the symmetry was **not earned**. `Footing` is flat because something counts
with it: `CorpusHealth.footings` is a `BTreeMap<Footing, _>` and `doctor` buckets
by it in seven places. `bearing()` had no caller at all outside its own tests.
The precedent was cited, not met — and a classification with no consumer is the
thing [[render-warrant]] says was never made.

What the fact side actually lacked was the *other* half of that precedent: a
corpus-level tally. [[runtime-corpus]] is where that landed, keyed by
`HoldingKind` and `KnowledgeKind` — payload-free tags in the shape `gmr-core`
already had for `Change`/`ChangeKind`, carrying no precedence and therefore
unable to grow one without the name becoming a lie.

## Where the orthogonal quantities went

Two things that look like they belong in the enum do not, and both are the same
mistake — a scale on a second axis wearing a variant's clothes:

- **Staleness.** `Knowledge::Seen` gives `at` and stops. Whether six hours is too
  old is the caller's threshold, not ours. GMR may take a freshness bound as an
  *observation instruction* — it decides whether to re-probe or serve what it
  has, the way `Budget` decides whether to keep probing — but it never returns a
  verdict about it.
- **Verifiability.** A field on `Seen`, never a variant. It is a grade of how the
  observation was obtained (see [[probe-Verifiability]]), and it is true
  simultaneously with whatever the fact did.

## `Blind` splits three ways because `ReasonClass` does

`Unreachable` / `Unusable` / `Unevaluable` are mapped by an exhaustive match, so
a fourth class cannot be forgotten — the compiler stops it.
[[journal-FailureCode]] is why the split is kept faithful rather than collapsed:
a store that will not answer, a probe whose output cannot be used, and rules that
cannot be evaluated are three different people's problem.

`NeverAsked` is split off from `TimedOut` for the reason [[content-budget]] gives
on the other side: a fact nobody had time to reach is our budget's doing, not
somebody else's outage, and `Footing` already makes the same split for content.

## `Absent` outranks `Moved`, and that costs something

A fact that moved *to* gone is both. `Absent` wins, because "the thing this
memory is about is not there" is the more specific answer and the one a reader
acts on — but the seq and the axes go with `Moved`, so taking `Absent` gives up
saying *when* it vanished. That is a deliberate trade and not a free one; if the
vanishing moment turns out to be what people ask for, the answer is a field on
`Absent`, not a reshuffle of the precedence.

## The diff decides, the seq only gates it

`holding` is **not** `bound_at_seq < moved_at`. That comparison was the first
shape and it was wrong in a way the code could see and did not look at: a
recapture restates the anchor and re-observes it, so it advances `moved_at`
while landing on the state it left. Every dated memory then reported
`Moved` with an **empty** axis list — a claim about the ground contradicted by
the very diff attached to it. One `gmr rebase --all` after an extractor upgrade
says that about the whole corpus at once, which is [[runtime-moved-at]]'s alert
firehose arriving through the other door.

So the state diff decides and `moved_at` only gates it: `bound >= moved_at`
means no state change has happened since the bind, so the fold can be skipped.
The gate is now what decides whether the journal is read at all: `holding` takes
the log rather than a slice of entries, answers `Holds`, `Absent` or `Undated`
off the view alone, and calls `entries` only on the far side of the gate, where
`folded` does the comparison. Folding back to the moment of binding is the one
question in the read path that genuinely needs the whole log, and it is now the
only thing that asks for it.
Past that gate the answer comes from comparing the two states, and an empty diff
is `Holds` — including when the world moved out and came back, which is the same
early cutoff [[runtime-moved-at]] argues for one level down.

## An instrument that changed is not a world that moved

The diff runs **first**, and an empty one is `Holds` even across two different
extractors. That is not a shortcut: two instruments producing byte-identical
state is positive evidence that they agree about this symbol, and answering
`Incomparable` there would throw it away — this repository would carry hundreds
of unanswerable memories after every extractor upgrade that changed nothing it
extracts.

The question only arises once something differs. Each is read by
whatever extractor was current when it was written, and `Versions::derivation`
records which — so the check is reading the ledger, not interpreting it.
Different versions means a non-empty diff is not commensurable: it would answer
"did the world move" with "the instrument changed shape", and those cannot be
told apart from here.

This is not a hypothetical. This repository's own corpus had 74 memories
reporting `Moved` on axes like `baseline.name` and `v.file` — keys the newer
extractor started emitting — with every `body` hash identical on both sides.
Nothing had moved. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §10.4 asks exactly this of a
consumer: every observation records the three identities so a corpus-wide
flip coming from a rules upgrade can be told from a world change — recording
the versions without that plan would fix the record and not the explosion. `Incomparable` is that plan. It is also the memory-level twin of what
the CLI already says one layer up when a probe version moves — that the stored
baseline and what this build measures cannot be told apart — so it is the same
idea at the layer that needed it, not a new one.

Re-reading it takes a fresh binding, not a recapture: recapture re-pins the
anchor, and the memory is still dated against a reading nobody re-took. Nothing
in `accept --baseline` moves `bound_at_seq`; only a new dated assertion does.

## Silence is not disagreement

The paragraph above stops one step short, and the corpus paid for the gap: 91
notes here sat at `Incomparable` and **45 of them differed only by `baseline.name`
and `baseline.file` — paths the newer extractor started emitting and the older
one had never measured.** The old reading did not contradict them. It was silent
about them, and silence was being counted as a disagreement.

So when the instruments differ, a path **added** by the newer one is dropped
before the answer is decided, and an otherwise-empty diff is `Holds`. This is the
same argument as the empty-diff case one paragraph up, applied per path instead
of per state: agreement on everything both instruments measured is positive
evidence, and a path only one of them measures carries no evidence either way.

**Removals still count, and that is what closes the rename.** A path that
vanished is not silence — it is an instrument that stopped looking, and nothing
here can say whether what it used to measure moved. A renamed key arrives as an
addition *and* a removal, so the removal is the half that refuses, and a rename
can never be mistaken for `Holds`. A test holds both halves.

What survives is what should: 46 notes here still disagree on paths both
instruments measure — `baseline.body`, `baseline.after`, `v.place`, `v.logic` —
and those genuinely cannot be told apart from here. That is the number a person
has to read, and it was never 91.

## `Undated` is not `NeverEstablished`

`bound_at_seq` is `NULL` on every binding written before the column existed, and
those rows cannot be compared against the log at all. Answering
`NeverEstablished` said *no ground was ever established* — false about a note
that is bound and whose anchor is settled, and it was the answer for more than
half of this repository's own notes. `NeverEstablished` keeps the case it was
named for: a binding whose seq predates the anchor's first entry, where there
genuinely was no ground yet.

## `axes` is a diff, not a vocabulary

`Moved { axes }` names the **state paths that differ** between the state as of
`bound_at_seq` and the state now. The base computes it without knowing what any
of them mean — `v.sig` is a path, not a word it understands — so this stays
inside rule 4's "no fixed state vocabulary".

`position` is excluded at the top level — it is where we looked rather than
what we found, a core constant the base may know without interpreting (rules 2
and 3). `status` is excluded only when something else also differs: there it is
the summary the rule table wrote from the rest, and counting it would report one
movement twice. When status is the *only* divergence there is no "rest" that
wrote it — a hand-written table may produce a complete state of exactly
`position` and `status`, and skipping it unconditionally made every transition
of such an anchor diff empty, so a claim bound to it answered `Holds` while the
anchor said breached. The sole-divergence case is the whole signal and is
reported.

`differing` walks arrays as well as objects, by index. It stopped at arrays
once, and a reading that is a *list* of things — a menu, a roster, a price table
— then reported as the single path `value`: `Moved` could say the list changed
and never which row. The cost of walking is that inserting at the front reports
every element after it; that is honest, and it is what happened, while "the
whole list" was the same claim with less of the answer in it.

A path into an array is an index, and an index is only a name while the order
holds. That is the probe's business, not the base's: a reading whose order is
not stable is a reading whose diff nobody can read, in exactly the way a `SELECT`
whose columns get reordered is (see [[transport-sql]]).

## When this changes, ask

Does a variant arrive that could be true at the same time as another? Then it is
a third axis, and the answer is a field, not a variant. That question is the
whole reason this is a struct.

Does something start deciding `holding` from a seq comparison again? `moved_at`
is a cursor: it says the state changed, never that it changed *away from what
this memory was bound to*. Only the diff says that.

Does a flat fold of the two axes come back? Ask what its precedence says. If the
sentence is about whether a caller may rely on the answer, it is a verdict
wearing an observation's clothes, and the last one got as far as being publicly
exported from two crates before anyone asked.

Does a path start being dropped from the diff for any reason other than the
older instrument never having measured it? Dropping a *removal* is the rename
hole, and dropping a shared path is answering "did the world move" with a
shrug.
